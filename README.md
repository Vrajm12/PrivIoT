PrivIoT is a security analysis tool for IoT devices.
It evaluates devices based on privacy sensitivity, potential vulnerabilities, and security posture, providing actionable recommendations.


---

Key Features

Attribute-Based Analysis → Evaluate IoT devices using structured parameters.

Privacy Sensitivity Scoring → Weighted metrics for sensitive data exposure.

Vulnerability Indicators → Highlights potential risks from device design and data flow.

Flask Frontend → Interactive UI for users to input device attributes.

Scalable Backend → Modular Python logic with roadmap for ML integration.

Frontend: Flask (UI forms for device info)
Backend: Python-based logic (scoring, evaluation)
Planned: Integration of ML models and vulnerability databases


Example Workflow
Input (User provides):

{
  "device": "Smart Camera",
  "data_collected": ["video", "audio"],
  "cloud_storage": true,
  "encryption": false
}

Output (Analyzer):

{
  "privacy_sensitivity": "High",
  "security_score": 65,
  "recommendation": "Enable end-to-end encryption and restrict 3rd-party sharing."
}

Why PrivIoT?

Most IoT analysis tools focus purely on vulnerabilities.
PrivIoT adds an ethical and privacy-aware layer to IoT security analysis.
